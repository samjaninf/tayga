.SH NAME
tayga \- stateless NAT64 daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]tayga\f[R] \f[I][OPTION]\&...\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]tayga \-\-mktun\f[R] \f[I][OPTION]\&...\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]tayga \-\-rmtun\f[R] \f[I][OPTION]\&...\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
TAYGA is a stateless NAT64 daemon for Linux and FreeBSD.
Using the in\-kernel TUN network driver, TAYGA receives IPv4 and IPv6
packets from the host\(cqs network stack, translates them to the other
protocol, and then sends the translated packets back to the host using
the same TUN interface.
.PP
Translation is compliant with IETF RFC 7915, and address mapping is
performed in accordance with RFC 6052 and RFC 7757.
Optionally, TAYGA may be configured to dynamically map IPv6 hosts to
addresses drawn from a configured IPv4 address pool.
.PP
As a stateless NAT, TAYGA requires a one\-to\-one mapping between IPv4
addresses and IPv6 addresses.
Mapping multiple IPv6 addresses onto a single IPv4 address can be
achieved by mapping IPv6 addresses to private IPv4 addresses with TAYGA
and then using a stateful NAT44 (such as the iptables(8) MASQUERADE
target) to map the private IPv4 addresses onto the desired single IPv4
address.
.PP
TAYGA\(cqs configuration is stored in the tayga.conf(5) file, which is
usually found in /etc/tayga.conf or /usr/local/etc/tayga.conf.
.SH INVOCATION
Without the \f[B]\-\-mktun\f[R] or \f[B]\-\-rmtun\f[R] options, the
\(gatayga\(ga executable runs as a daemon, translating packets as
described above.
.PP
The \f[B]\-\-mktun\f[R] and \f[B]\-\-rmtun\f[R] options instruct
\(gatayga\(ga to create or destroy, respectively, its configured TUN
device as a \(lqpersistent\(rq interface and then immediately exit.
.PP
Persistent TUN devices remain present on the host system even when
\(gatayga\(ga is not running.
This allows host\-side network parameters and firewall rules to be
configured prior to commencement of packet translation.
This may simplify network configuration on the host; for example,
systems which use a Debian\-style /etc/network/interfaces file may
configure tayga\(cqs TUN device at boot by running \(gatayga
\-\-mktun\(ga as a \(lqpre\-up\(rq command and then configuring the TUN
device as any other network interface.
